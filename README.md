# pomodoro-telegram-bot
Hosted on Heroku, using Flask.
You can find the bot [here](https://telegram.me/studytimer_bot).

## What I'm currently using
0. [python-3.9.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-392/)
1. [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) as know as Telebot
2. [Flask-2.0.1](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) 
3. [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) for free hosting

## Good advice
Read as much as possible [Telebot](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI#writing-your-first-bot) and [Telegram-Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api). Everything you require is there, unfortunately you need to read a bit.
